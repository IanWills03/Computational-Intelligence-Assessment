Congressional Voting Analysis: Custom ANN & K-Means Clustering

This project applies computational intelligence techniques to the UCI Congressional Voting Records dataset to classify political affiliations.

Custom ANN from Scratch: Developed a 3-layer feedforward neural network in Python using the Sigmoid activation function and Backpropagation, built entirely without machine learning libraries.

Comparative Analysis: Evaluated model performance across different architectures (10, 20, and 30 hidden neurons) using confusion matrices, precision, recall, and F1-scores.

Library Integration: Benchmarked the custom model against a Scikit-learn/Keras implementation to discuss the trade-offs of manual vs. automated frameworks.

Unsupervised Learning: Implemented K-Means Clustering, using the Elbow Method to determine optimal clusters and comparing discovered groupings to original class labels.
